# Security Checklist for BudEvent

## ‚úÖ **Implemented Security Measures**

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- [x] JWT-based sessions with NextAuth
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- [x] Foreign key constraints maintaining data integrity
- [x] User ownership validation for events

### Input Validation
- [x] Zod schema validation for registration
- [x] Email format validation and normalization
- [x] Password complexity requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- [x] Name length limits (1-100 characters)

### API Security
- [x] Rate limiting on registration (3 attempts per 15 minutes)
- [x] Input sanitization and validation
- [x] Proper error handling without information leakage

### Session Security
- [x] Secure cookie configuration
- [x] Session timeout (1 day)
- [x] Session update frequency (every hour)
- [x] HTTP-only cookies in production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Recommendations**

### High Priority
- [ ] **Email verification** - Require email confirmation before account activation
- [ ] **Password reset functionality** - Secure password recovery process
- [ ] **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** - Additional security layer
- [ ] **Account lockout** - Prevent brute force attacks

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Session management** - Allow users to view/revoke active sessions
- [ ] **Audit logging** - Track user actions for security monitoring
- [ ] **IP-based restrictions** - Optional geographic or IP range restrictions
- [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP)** - Prevent XSS attacks

### Low Priority
- [ ] **CAPTCHA integration** - Bot protection for forms
- [ ] **Advanced rate limiting** - Per-endpoint and per-user limits
- [ ] **Security headers** - HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- [ ] **Vulnerability scanning** - Regular security audits

## üîí **Production Security Checklist**

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (32+ random characters)
- [ ] Secure `DATABASE_URL` with proper permissions
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` set to production domain
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production

### Database Security
- [ ] Regular database backups
- [ ] Database access logging enabled
- [ ] Connection encryption (TLS)
- [ ] Minimal database user permissions

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting at load balancer level
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for security events

## üö® **Security Best Practices**

1. **Never commit sensitive data** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all secrets
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Implement principle of least privilege** for database access
5. **Regular security updates** for dependencies
6. **Monitor for suspicious activity** and failed login attempts
7. **Have a security incident response plan**

## üìä **Current Security Score: 7/10**

**Strengths:**
- Solid authentication foundation
- Good input validation
- Proper database security
- Rate limiting implemented

**Areas for improvement:**
- Email verification missing
- 2FA not implemented
- Limited audit logging
- No account lockout protection

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. Implement email verification
2. Add password reset functionality
3. Consider 2FA implementation
4. Set up security monitoring
5. Regular security audits
